Hi, Iâ€™m @AustinLalonde and I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and am very interested in data analytics and using information to solve the worlds problems. I am well versed in python data analytics, reporting, and have a working knowledge of machine learning. I am interested in learning about cloud computing technologies, web development, and further refining my python skills.
